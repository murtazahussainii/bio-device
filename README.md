# Bio-Device

This repository contains the front-end implementation of a biomedical interface prototype developed using React. It was created for an academic project as part of the *Introduction to Biomedical Engineering* course. The purpose of this project is to simulate the UI of a biomedical monitoring or diagnostic device.

---

## Project Overview

The application presents a modular and responsive user interface designed to represent real-time physiological data or system outputs from biomedical sensors. While the backend is not implemented, this project focuses on UI structure, layout, and data visualization readiness.

---

## Features

- Developed using the Create React App framework
- Simulated interface for displaying sensor readings
- Clean and responsive UI for medical device applications
- Structured and maintainable codebase for future integration

---

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Front-end library
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic and scripting
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **HTML** – Base structure
